## About the Project ##

The web page is to show the grade of the students in the group. There are two selection boxes, which you can choose the student and semester.
If you select the student and semester, there will be two tables shown.
The first table shows the list of courses that the student had register in that semester and the grade of each course.
However, the grade of each course is empty if the current semester is selected.
The second table shows the credit earned and GPA in that semster, also total credit and GPA as well.
Even though the current semester is selected, the total credit and GPA are still shown.
